============

coredis is a fork of `aredis <https://github.com/NoneGG/aredis>`_ originally developed and maintained by Jason Chen.

Most of the implementation details mirror those in :doc:`redis-py <redis-py:index>` originally written by
Andy McCurdy and now maintained by redis.

The redis cluster implementation was initially ported from `redis-py-cluster <https://github.com/Grokzen/redis-py-cluster>`_ written by Grokzen
and is now tracking the cluster client implementation in the official :doc:`redis-py <redis-py:index>` client.
