Project History
===============

coredis is a fork of `aredis <https://github.com/NoneGG/aredis>`_ originally
developed and maintained by Jason Chen.

The library no longer maintains backwards compatibility with the original implementation,
however a `2.x <https://github.com/alisaifee/coredis/tree/2.x>`__ branch and release is (somewhat) maintained.
